*THOU still unravish'd bride of quietness,*

*Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,*

*Sylvan historian, who canst thus express*

*A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:*

*What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape*

*Of deities or mortals, or of both,*

*In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?*

*What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?*

*What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?*

*What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?*
